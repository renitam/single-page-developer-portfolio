# Exploring the Effects of Data


## Summary
I used a FrontendMentor portfolio template to create my portfolio and utilized different portfolio projects to showcase my JavaScript, React, Gatsby, TypeScript and NextJS skills.

## Solution


## Approach


# The Project Scenario
- Fuck my life.

## Overview
- Step into shoes of recent graduate looking for job in tech industry

---

## Objectives
- Integrate HTML, CSS & JavaScript into website
- Showcase other work already done and other online presence
- Provide further information on qualifications, references, and contact info

## Challenge
- Create a professional website that showcases your qualifications, experience, samples and other online presences
- Make design decisions, outline the content, create website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Share your reflections

# See Example Projects

- Create unique analyses by viewing finished product, not the code behind itd

## Examples of finished portfolios

### Example 1: 
- [Site 1](https://skyroute66.com/sampleportfolio/)
Review
- Great performance, responsive, clearly highlights work
- Poetry bot was creative and engaging
- Easy to read qualifications, work experience & contact info

### Example 2: 
-[Site 2](https://skyroute66.com/sampleportfolio2/)
Review
- This is the same exact website in a different color palette
- Interactive JS graphics on scroll make website unique and showcases animation skills
- Loving the color scheme and accessibility of this example; more visibility/contrast

# Working Off-Platform

## Getting Started
- Use IDE and web browser. I'm using VS Code & Google Chrome
- Install Live Server to test code throughout
- Bookmark common documentation, cheat codes, and other dev resources

## Debugging Tips + Resources
### 1. View a task-by-task guide
- E.g. [Coursera: Build a Portfolio Website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/showcase-build-a-portfolio-website-html-css-javascript/resources/zDrOV)
- Each stage contains add'l resources to unstick you

### 2. Use browser built-in debugging tools
- Many browsers have debugging tools
- Chrome has a debug guide here: [Debugging with the Chrome Browser](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/)

### 3. Google your question
- Check [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### 4. Read documentation
- Carefully read through docs for any language and library you use
- They have examples of what you're looking for

### 5. Rubber ducking
- Explain a problem to a friend
- You'll figure out the solution while explaining it
- If not, get another set of eyes on your code
